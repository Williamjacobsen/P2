# How to Start Server on Your Own Local PC:

For frontend:
1) Create new terminal inside the project root folder.
2) Enter "cd frontend".
3) Enter "npm start".

For backend:
1) Create new terminal inside the project root folder.
2) Enter "cd backend".
3) Enter either "node --watch server.js" or "node server.js".

For MySQL (only relevant if you have disabled starting it on system boot-up):
1) In Windows Search, search for "services" (Danish: "tjenester")
2) Open the "services" app.
3) Find the service "MySQL80".
4) Right-click it and press "start".
5) You can now connect to your MySQL database using the MySQL Workbench app.

# Included and required packages

How to navigate inside the terminal:
* "cd " + the name of the folder you wish to navigate to.

Required packages in the frontend folder (these ARE NOT installed in the project due to size, so they MUST be installed by yourself):
* "npm install"

Included packages in the backend folder (these ARE ALREADY installed in the project):
* "npm install bcrypt jsonwebtoken node-schedule"

FAQ:
* If you get an error saying that running scripts is disabled on the system, then enter the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser" and try running "npm install" again.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
